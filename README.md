🎓 Student Performance Tracker

An end-to-end SQL + PL/SQL project designed to simulate a real academic grading system.
This project automates the evaluation and reporting process for students — including schema design, data entry, procedures, triggers, and analytics.

📘 Project Overview

The system maintains student, subject, marks, and result information.
It calculates grades automatically using stored procedures and generates reports through database views.

🧩 Project Workflow

ER Diagram – Defines entities and relationships

Schema Creation – Creates all master and transaction tables

Sample Data Insertion – Populates tables with test data

Procedures – Automates result calculation

Views & Reports – Generates performance summaries and insights

Triggers – Ensures data integrity and logs key updates
